        <p> Rosalind Elsie Franklin was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer. 
            Her research was cruical in our understanding in the molecular structures of DNA and RNA. 
            It helped reveal how DNA econdes and replicates genetic information which formed the basis of 
            modern molecular biology, genetic enegineering and gene therapy.
            As a result of her work in DNA being largely unrecognized during her life, this page is written to give a brief overview about it.
